# Bitcoin-Privatekey-QR

This is  a simple application to display QR codes of bitcoin private keys.
It accepts private keys in  [Wallet Import Format](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format).
It also displays the bitcoin address for each key.

I put this together so I could use the same addresses on my computer and on my mobile. This is a quick hack, it's barely usable.
